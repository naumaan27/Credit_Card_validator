# Credit_Card_validator
This project is a Python-based Credit Card Validator that verifies whether a given credit card number is valid or not using the Luhn Algorithm.  The Luhn Algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate identification numbers such as credit card numbers. It helps detect accidental errors like mistyped or incorrect card numbers.
